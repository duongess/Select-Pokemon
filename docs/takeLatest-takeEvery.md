# Key Differences:

## **takeEvery**
1. Handles every action dispatched
2. Processes all requests in parallel

### **Use Cases:**
- Logging actions
- Analytics tracking
- Independent operations that all need to complete

### **Pros:**
- No requests are dropped
- All operations complete

### **Cons:**
- Can overwhelm resources
- May cause race conditions
- Multiple responses may conflict

---

## **takeLatest**
1. Only processes the most recent action
2. Cancels any previous ongoing operations

### **Use Cases:**
- Search/autocomplete
- Form submissions
- API requests where only the latest result matters

### **Pros:**
- Prevents race conditions
- Saves resources
- Clear latest-wins semantics

### **Cons:**
- Previous operations are cancelled
- May drop important requests

---

## **When to Use Each**

### **Use `takeEvery` when:**
```typescript
// Example: Logging user actions
function* logActionsSaga() {
  yield takeEvery('*', function* (action) {
    yield call(analyticsService.logAction, action)
  })
}
